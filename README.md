# Hi, I'm Daniel. 👋
## Take a look around 👀 to see some of the personal and group programming projects I've worked on.

🔭 I'm currently working on projects for my Computer Vision I and Database Systems courses as well as my Honors College capstone.

🌱 For these classes I'm refreshing my Python and Java skills as well as really diving into and formally learning SQL for the first time.

⚠️ Unfornately I cannot post many of my cool projects until after I graduate because they were created for my college courses and could violate academic integrity.
