# Hey. ✌️ I'm Daniel. 🧑🏽‍🦱
## Take a look around to see some of the personal and group programming projects I've worked on.

🎓 I recently graduated in December 2021 from The University of Illinois Chicago with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. 
My last semester I worked on projects in Computer Vision and Database Systems as well as a Honors capstone that explored simplifying user interfaces by integrating AI into an existing application.

🌱 I'm currently learning and growing working as a Software Engineer at a tech company. 

⚠️ Unfornately I cannot post some of my coolest projects because they were created for my college courses and could violate academic integrity.
